# ShopMate - AI Shopping Assistant

ShopMate is an intelligent, conversational shopping assistant aimed at transforming the e-commerce experience. By leveraging the power of Google's Gemini AI and Algolia's high-speed search, ShopMate allows users to find products, compare options, and explore categories using natural language.

## 🎯 Goal

The primary goal of ShopMate is to bridge the gap between static search bars and human-like assistance. Instead of browsing through endless filters, users can simply ask:
> "I'm looking for a drone under $500 with a 4K camera."
> "What are some good laptops for gaming?"

ShopMate understands the intent, retrieves relevant products from the catalog, and presents them in a conversational format.

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## 🔍 Workings

The application follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, though strictly using function calling to interface with structured data.

1.  **User Input**: The user types a query in the chat interface.
2.  **API Route**: The request is sent to `/api/chat`.
3.  **AI Processing**: The Google Gemini model processes the natural language input.
    - If the user asks for products, the model detects the intent and calls the `searchProducts` tool.
    - If the user asks about categories, it calls `getCategories`.
4.  **Tool Execution**: The server executes the function, querying Algolia for real-time data.
5.  **Response Generation**: The search results are fed back to Gemini, which synthesizes a friendly, helpful response summarizing the products found.

## ⚡ Retrieval via Algolia

The core of ShopMate's product discovery engine is powered by **Algolia**.

- **Index**: The application queries an index named `styles` (configured in `src/lib/algolia.ts`).
- **Method**: We use the `searchSingleIndex` method from the `algoliasearch` (v5) client.
- **Attributes**: To optimize context window usage for the LLM, we retrieve only essential attributes:
    - `name`, `description`, `brand`
    - `price`, `rating`, `image`
    - `categories`
- **Relevance**: The search query generated by the LLM is matched against the Algolia index to ensure highly relevant results, handling typos and synonyms automatically.

### Code Snippet (`src/lib/algolia.ts`)

```typescript
export async function searchProducts(query: string, filters?: string) {
  const result = await client.searchSingleIndex({
    indexName: 'styles',
    searchParams: {
      query,
      filters,
      hitsPerPage: 10,
      attributesToRetrieve: ['name', 'brand', 'price', ...],
    },
  });
  return result.hits;
}
```
